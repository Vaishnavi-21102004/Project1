Project Title: Online Doctor Recommendation System
                  The Online Doctor Recommendation System is a web-based application designed to help patients find and connect with suitable doctors based on their symptoms or medical conditions. The system allows users to input their symptoms, after which it recommends doctors specializing in the relevant medical field. The platform supports user registration and login for both patients and doctors. Doctors can manage their profiles, specialization, and availability, while patients can view doctor profiles.
The system is developed using HTML for the front-end interface, PHP for server-side scripting, and PostgreSQL for managing database operations. It ensures secure authentication, user-friendly navigation, and efficient data handling to provide a seamless healthcare experience online.
